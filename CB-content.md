Success stories:
Through the Elevate program, Accessline strengthened its team by hiring Train-to-Hire interns, providing the resources needed to deliver real projects. In September 2025, Accessline secured a major WHO project valued at 300,000 NIS over a 6–8 month period, focused on estimating casualties in Gaza. This capacity enabled Accessline to deliver key work, open new growth opportunities, and offer hiring opportunities to 3 of the Elevate interns. The company is now taking on six additional projects, further driving its growth and resilience in Gaza’s challenging environment.
Hexa Company achieved a major milestone with MIRA, an AI-powered smart health app for women. This app uses camera and voice technology to assess physical and mental well-being and provides personalized guidance. The project was accepted in the first stage of a UNICEF competition, with an estimated funding of $100,000. (It's called MIRA, from the word “Mirror”, as users scan their appearance and voice with the camera and voice to assess physical and mental health issues).
